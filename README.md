# Tutorial Marking Application

iOS Application for KIT305 using XCode and Swift.

It's scrappy (especially the storyboard-based UI), but it was a great learning experience :)

This project uses Google Firebase and Firestore which both have been taken down for obvious reasons,
however this does mean that the program will not have any functionality.
